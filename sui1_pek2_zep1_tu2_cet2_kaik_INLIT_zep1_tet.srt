1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Hello everyone. This is Quafo.

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:06,490
And

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,310
This is Pezepunuk.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,910
And today,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,140
Me and Pezepunuk and Kuiui Gaukaku

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,310
I'm here

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,480
And we play Setkaik.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,130
Let's get started!

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,740
spring

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,620
Come on!

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,180
three.

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,460
three.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,080
two.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,710
go!

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
Oh good.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,340
Then...

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,780
Let's go here

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,520
General, right?

19
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,070
Let's advance the soldiers.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,850
Very good.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,080
Very strong

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,480
Well then

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,620
I'll go here

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,780
Then advance the bow and it's a constant bow.

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,950
A constant bow?

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,150
Hmm, hmm.

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,910
Yup.

28
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,680
Good

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,980
It's a good road.

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,410
three.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,250
three.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,510
Then I too

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,480
Constant bow.

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,350
A constant bow?

35
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,350
Hmm

36
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,510
Take that bow.

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,610
Bow, oh do you take a bow?

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,050
Then I

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,280
Take a bow with a soldier. Isn't it good?

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,510
Then move the bow.

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,080
Will you move the bow~~

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:56,980
very good.

43
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,410
Then I want to move the car.

44
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,710
But I can't move it.

45
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,850
Ah, different, different.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,810
Is there?

47
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,810
You can go here.

48
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,310
Oops

49
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,680
Then proceed with the shrine maiden.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,310
Take a brush

51
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,550
Oh

52
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,950
Ah!

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,450
Then I

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,310
Oh good

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,950
Move the car... move the car.

56
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,410
Alright! Then here!

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,680
The shogun is in the Imperial Palace...

58
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,850
General of the Imperial Palace.

59
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,350
Oh.

60
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,710
three.

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,050
Oh

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,310
Yup

63
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,880
If you take a general

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,010
Sho? Oh.

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,870
Sho?

66
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,780
If you take a general

67
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,550
You can make a "culture".

68
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,480
Then this is

69
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,660
Horse.

70
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,130
Horse?

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,030
so. Horse.

72
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,360
Or soldiers. Or soldiers.

73
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,530
Horse

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,190
Or soldiers.

75
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,360
Horse or soldier.

76
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,530
HMâ€¦

77
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,260
I want to get soldiers.

78
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,830
Ah!

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,030
Oh, go down?

80
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,230
Went down.

81
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,560
I think this move is good.

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,930
Is it good?

83
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,090
good.

84
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,660
Hmm...

85
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,560
good.

86
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,890
Going "down" would be "at a disadvantage" in this battle.

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,590
What is good?

88
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,290
What is good

89
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,990
Then...

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,990
Let's move.

91
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Emperor! ?

92
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,460
The emperor...

93
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:02,920
Ahhhhh

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Emperor...

95
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,220
Why this is good...

96
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,720
Move the emperor here.

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,220
e! ?

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,190
Yup

99
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,320
The shrine moves here.

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Well then

101
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,260
I'm in the Imperial Palace.

102
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:25,690
Emperor's office. eh?

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,220
Well then

104
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,850
Climb up and down!

105
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,980
Then... throw the throwing rod

106
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,250
Aa! !!

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,070
Alright! three!

108
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,300
Take the king!

109
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,270
And "Culture" and "King" are completed!

110
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,100
Last season?

111
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,530
And 12 points.

112
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,370
Rerun? Rerun?

113
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,570
12.

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,030
Well then

115
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,270
The end of the season!

116
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,430
Oh, good.

117
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,570
summer

118
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,610
Alright!

119
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,010
Okay.

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,410
Alright!

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,110
Throw a throwing rod!

122
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,940
Fight throwing throwers!

123
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,810
Come on!

124
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,640
Ah!

125
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,170
the same!

126
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,910
the same!

127
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,910
Is it the same~

128
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,270
again!

129
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,270
I threw a throwing bar four times...

130
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:22,810
two.

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,170
four.

132
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,040
Constant bow

133
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,770
A constant bow?

134
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,170
Is this good? do not know.

135
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,310
zero! ?

136
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,880
What god came here! ?

137
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,280
Constant bow.

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,880
That's zero too, right?

139
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,350
Another constant bow.

140
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,180
There are no throwing rods, right?

141
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,480
I don't have a god.

142
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,250
Come on!

143
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,650
Alright!

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,580
Then it seems good to take it.

145
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,380
It's a good road.

146
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll take it.

147
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,080
A constant bow?

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,780
Then here.

149
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Good

150
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,650
Good idea?

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,250
Lipaline?

152
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,550
Yup.

153
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Can speak Lipaline?

154
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,680
can not speak.

155
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:40,980
can not speak.

156
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,820
Can't you talk?

157
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,220
"Hello" it can be said.

158
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,380
Oh
Oh

159
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,880
I think it's good.

160
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,950
I have to fight.

161
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,220
A bow is approaching us!

162
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,720
Raise the king.

163
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,220
King?

164
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,280
What to take

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,580
Should go... should take

166
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,880
A pair of bows!

167
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,750
this is good!

168
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,620
But this play is not good.

169
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,550
What are you doing?

170
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,120
Emperor's office.

171
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,950
Ah!

172
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,850
I can do this.

173
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,080
How nice.

174
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,550
My king will be taken by you.

175
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,180
But the imperial water...

176
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,520
Do you take...

177
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh, throwing stick! ?

178
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,220
Come on!

179
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,350
Alright!
Oh

180
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,220
Who uses three bows

181
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,980
Bow bow bow

182
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,080
Bow bow bow

183
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,550
Lower the soldiers.

184
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,650
Lower the soldiers.

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,950
Let's take a horse.

186
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,850
Is it a horse?

187
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,620
good.

188
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,350
I came.

189
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,720
A good god has come.

190
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,220
Let's take a bow.

191
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,550
The shrine here.

192
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,080
Where are you going?

193
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,680
I want to get a horse.

194
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,720
here

195
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,050
I can take this bow.

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,580
Yes Yes

197
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,110
Let's go down.

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,810
Let's go here

199
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,080
Come on!

200
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,780
Yes Yes

201
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,310
